This is an example of using sagas with takeLatest to "debounce" multiple simultaneous actions. Conceptually it works like this:

Clicking the button causes an action to be dispatched
This action is captured by the saga middleware and a saga instance is started
The saga instance has an initial delay which returns control to the saga manager
If another action is dispatched while the first saga instance is waiting for the delay to resolve the old saga instance is never resumed and a new saga instance is created.
This process can be repeated until the saga instance is completed.
